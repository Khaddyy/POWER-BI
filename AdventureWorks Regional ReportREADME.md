# POWER-BI
INTRODUCTION
I came across this dataset online and after searching for a befitting dataset for my first solo project, it seemed like the perfect option to practise my acquired skills of data cleaning, analysis and visualizations with.

Power BI concepts applied :
1.	DAX Concepts
2.	Data Modelling

Problem Statement
1.	Percentage variance, variance, budget and sales.
2.	Budget and sales amount according to sub-category.
3.	Budget and sales comparison by month.
4.	Variance by month.
5.	Variance by category and sub-category.

Data Sourcing
With theabove in mind, I downloaded the csv file, extracted it into Power BI for cleaning, analysis and visualization with guidance from an expert.

Data Cleaning
Data was cleaned and transformed with the Power Query Editor of Power BI. Some applied steps include:
1.	Made first rows as headers.
2.	Created new column for ProductKey.
