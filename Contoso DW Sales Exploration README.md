# POWER-BI
	INTRODUCTION    
I obtained this dataset via DataCamp for one of itsexercises on Power BI. And this dataset required cleaning.

Power BI Concepts
1.	Data Modelling

Problem Statement
1.	Actual amount, budget amount,forecast amount and product category.
2.	Amount sold by entity name.
3.	Analysis of product category based on the budgeted monthly amount.
4.	Most product sold
5.	Maximum and minimum product sold by regions.

Data Sourcing:
With the above in mind for analysis, I downloaded and extracted the csv file made available into Power BI for cleaning(transformation) and preparation for analysis.
Data Cleaning:
Data was cleaned and transformed with the Power Query Editor of Power BI. Some of the applied steps include;
1.	Made first row as header
2.	Created a hierachy

Data Modelling:
Power BI automatically connected related tables in a star schema model.
